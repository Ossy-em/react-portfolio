export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
Hey, I’m a frontend developer who loves building web apps that look great and work even better. With years of professional experience, I’ve worked with tools like React, Firebase, Material-UI, and ApexCharts to create projects that are simple, smooth, and useful. My journey into web development started with me just being curious about how websites work, and now I’m all about solving problems and creating awesome user experiences.  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably watching football (huge FC Barcelona fan here). I also enjoy catching NBA games every now and then. Outside of sports, I like trying out new tech, finding ways to sleep earlier than 3am, and just figuring out better ways to do things.  `;
